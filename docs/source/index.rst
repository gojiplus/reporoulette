RepoRoulette provides multiple methods for randomly sampling GitHub repositories:

* **ID-based sampling**: Probes random repository IDs
* **Temporal sampling**: Weighted sampling based on repository activity by time period  
* **BigQuery sampling**: Advanced querying using Google BigQuery's GitHub dataset
* **GitHub Archive sampling**: Event-based sampling from GitHub Archive files

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from reporoulette import sample
   
   # Sample 10 repositories using temporal sampling
   results = sample(method='temporal', n_samples=10)
   print(f"Found {len(results['samples'])} repositories")
